<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Welcome to the 
  Invoice Application. This program was developed for one single reason, which 
  was to learn how to use the print function in VB. This program has turned out 
  to be a big success and I have programmed it so that anybody can use it. This 
  help file was created not to show you how to use this program step by step, 
  but to debug your errors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you find that 
  you are trying to print and cannot then follow these instructions:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Have you entered 
    in your ABN (Australian Business Number)? If you haven't then look at the 
    first number in the menu and click it, enter your ABN and click the Done button.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are still 
    getting that error, then enter the business address or name by clicking the 
    second button and entering your data.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are still 
    getting that error, then enter the person's name in the field at the bottom 
    and along with that enter some fields in the 'Form Entry Page'.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are still 
    getting an error, you must be thick.. go back to step 1 and follow through</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anyway, hopefully 
  you will understand how to use this program ALL by YOURSELF!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have any 
  problems, please e-mail me at muhy3@ihug.com.au. See ya later &amp; have fun!</font></p>
